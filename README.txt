AMPT is a tool for transforming MIDI messages originating from any external MIDI keyboard or other software in a performance or experimental setting. MIDI is routed and transformed in AMPT by linking devices on a virtual canvas. AMPT Filters will offer delay, echo, transpose, and arpeggio. AMPT also works as a MIDI router or loopback.
